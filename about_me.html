        <h1>About Me</h1>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My name is Steven and I'm a first-generation Asian American
            student from New York City. I was born in upstate New York
            and grew up in Staten Island for most of my life. Right now,
            I am 23 years old.
        </p>
        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>I am the youngest child of four. I have two older sisters, named
            Diana and Sabrina, and one older brother named Eddie. My dad is 
            Bun and my mom is Xiao. 
        </p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Growing up I attended public schools in Staten Island and for college,
            I attended Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, studying Industrial and 
            Labor Relations.
        </p>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>I would describe myself to be more introverted than extroverted, though
            I can be social if needed, but I tend to lean towards getting closer to 
            my current friends than making new ones.
            <br>
            <br>
            I would describe myself as a kind, determined, family-oriented individual.
        </p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>League of Legends</strong> - I've spent too many hours of my life
            on this game. Partly because it's how I relax and partly because I get to stay 
        in contact with my friends.</li>
            <li><strong>Reading Books / Taking Courses</strong> - Since graduating, I've found
            an appreciation for learning things that I find a personal interest in, rather than
        something for a job or a class.</li>
            <li><strong>EDM Concerts</strong> - The social scene helps me to feel connected with
            friends, but also it gives me an excuse to drink and let loose. I also enjoy the music.</li>
            <li><strong>Girlfriend</strong> - Self explanatory lol</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Five Year Plan</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Move out of my parent's house</strong> - I think it's important for a young adult
            to be independent and be able to make decisions on their own. Particularly, this is the training
        grounds for decisions that I will make for the rest of my life. E.g. What I do with my time,
        Who I choose to surround myself with, What hobbies/ habits that I want to develop</li>
            <li><strong>Career Pivot to Software Engineer</strong> - Will explain more in my story tab. But TLDR
            want to accomplish this goal by YE 2024.</li>
            <li><strong>Fitness Goal</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Health Goal (maybe this is same)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Relationship Goal</strong> - What do I want my relationship to look like? My friendships
            to look like? Who are the main people in my life?</li>
        </ol>
